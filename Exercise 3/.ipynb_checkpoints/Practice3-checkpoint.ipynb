    "For this assignment, you will be using Python and Spark to analyze the [pointwise mutual information (PMI)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointwise_mutual_information) of tokens in the text of Shakespeare's plays.    For this assignment, you will need the same text file (`Shakespeare.txt`) and Python tokenizer module, `simple_tokenize.py`, that you used for the first two assignments.    You will also use the same definition of PMI that was used for [Assignment 1](https://www.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cs451/assignment1-431.html).\n",

    "#### Question 6  (6/30 marks):\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, write Spark code for the function `PMI_one_token`, that will take a positive integer threshold $T$ and a sample size $N$ as arguments. For every token $x$ in `Shakespeare.txt`, your code should find all tokens $y$ that co-occur with $x$ at least $T$ times, as well as PMI$(x,y)$ for each such pair, the co-occurrence count of the pair, the number of times $x$ appears, and the number of times $y$ appears.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each $x$, the output of your program should be equivalent to the output that would be produced by a One-Token query on $x$ (see Assignment 1), with threshold $T$. Rather than producing output for all possible tokens $x$, the function should produce output only for $N$ different $x$'s, chosen uniformly at random from among the $x$'s with a non-empty list of co-occurrences.\n",
    "\n",
    "If there are fewer than $N$ different $x$'s, then the function should output all of them.  In other words, if $T$ is very large, the function would output nothing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write your solution for question 6 by implementing the function `PMI_one_token` in the code cell below. It should use the `SparkContext` which was created previously (referenced by the variable `sc`). The function `PMI_one_token` should return a list of $N$ tuples of the form `(token, [ list_of_cooccurring_tokens ])`, where each entry in `list_of_cooccurring_tokens` is of the form `((token1, token2), pmi, cooc_count, token1_count, token2_count)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, if $N$ = 2 and the randomly selected tokens are \"if\" and \"you\", a valid format for the value returned by `PMI_one_token` would be:\n",
    "```\n",
    "[('if', [(('if', 'you'), -0.09813466615111513, 1975, 16624, 18237), (('if', 'a'), 0.03856379243802408, 1568, 16624, 10569)]), ('you', [(('you', 'if'), -0.09813466615111513, 1975, 18237, 16624)])]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint: Sampling must be done at the very last step.\n",
    "Hint: there is an action that returns a sample subset from an RDD. (`takeSample`)\n",
    "Note: You should be taking a \"stripes\" approach here. While you *can* use a pairs approach and then convert to stripes at the end, it's not as efficient."
